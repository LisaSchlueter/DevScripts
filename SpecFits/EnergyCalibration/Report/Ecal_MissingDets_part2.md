# Partition 2

## Missing detectors (energy calibration peak-fits):

| detector     | periods_run             |
|:------------ |:----------------------- |
| P00748B (11) | all runs in partition 2 |
| V01415A (13) | all runs in partition 2 |
| P00712A (26) | all runs in partition 2 |
| V01387A (71) | all runs in partition 2 |
| V01406A (84) | all runs in partition 2 |

## Existing detectors, but no charge trapping correction (energy calibration peak-fits):

all existing dets have ctc in partition 2
